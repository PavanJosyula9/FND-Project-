# FND-Project-
This is my first academic machine learning project. This project focuses on the detection of fake news which is common in social media. I utilized the scikit-learn library, a popular open-source library for the purposes of machine learning, to accomplish this project. I applied the concept of Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to retrieve the keyword in the corpus. Anyone who is familiar with the concepts of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) will certainly comprehend the TF-IDF and its applications. TF-IDF is an information retrieval technique and a statistical measure used to determine how important a word is to a document in a corpus. The classification is done by the PassiveAggressiveClassifier algorithm.The dataset consists of nearly 6300 text documents extracted from various social websites like Twitter, Facebook, etc. 80% of the text documents are classified as 'training set' and the rest is as 'test set'. I'm glad to publish my project, which secured an accuracy of about 94%, in GitHub.
