# FND-Project-
This is my first academic machine learning project. This project focuses on the detection of fake news which is common in social media. I utilized the scikit-learn library, a popular open-source library for the purposes of machine learning, to accomplish this project. I'm glad to publish my project, which secured an accuracy of about 94%, in GitHub.
